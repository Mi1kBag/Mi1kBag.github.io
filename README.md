<h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
<p>My full name is Jayden DÃ©shawn Gaynor and I was raised in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. I have one younger brother and both my parents live in Canada. I attended a boarding school in Hudson, Ohio where I studied and played soccer for two years. After the educational adventure, I was recruited to play soccer at Juniata College where I now study.</p>

<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
<p>I am looking to continue to expand and grow my knowledge. I am the first member of my family to study abroad and with that, there is a lot of pressure to lead the way for my younger brother and future generations. Although with this my aspirations to learn all I can continue to grow and flourish. I someday want to go to medical school so I can pursue a career in medicine which would also make me the first doctor in my family. I am looking to grow and progress as I continue to learn about various coding languages.</p>
